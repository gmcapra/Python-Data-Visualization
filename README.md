# Python-Data-Visualization
Repository for practice projects and scripts that utilize the Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, or other data visualization libraries to create, manipulate, and analyze dataframes with Python. Scripts can be run directly from the terminal or command line, provided the correct packages are already installed.

These files are intended to be used as reference material for creating new data visualizations.

Repository Contents:
- Seaborn Folder - contains reference scripts for data visualization with the Seaborn library
- Pandas Folder - contains reference scripts for data visualization built-into the Pandas library
- Plotly Folder - contains reference scripts for using Python with Plotly for Geoplotting and Choropleth Maps

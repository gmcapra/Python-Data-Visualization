# PythonDataVisualization
Using Python with Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to practice data frame creation, manipulation, and analysis.

Repository Contents:
In this repository there are 4 different scripts utilizing Pandas and Numpy to read and manipulate data from different sources. Run each script to see the contents of the sample data read, plotted, and analyzed with each respective data visualization library.

These scripts perform the following functions:
pandas_data_visualization.py      - Using Pandas Built-in Data Analysis to plot data
matplotlib_data_visualization.py  - Plotting Data with the Matplotlib library
seaborn_data_visualization.py     - Plotting Data with the Seaborn library
plotly_data_visualization.py      - Plotting Data with the Plotly library

These scripts can be run directly from the terminal or command line, provided the correct packages are already installed.
If there are any sample data files required for any of the scripts, they will be located within each folder.

Packages/Libraries Required:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
